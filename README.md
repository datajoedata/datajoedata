### Hello there terrestrians, ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository. You can call me Joe, I'm an aspiring Data Analyst with some affinity to biotech and biology. This space showcases a collection of projects and repositories that highlight my evolving skills and abilities. My primary toolset includes SQL, Python (bs4, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), Google Sheets, and Power BI. These tools enable me to efficiently extract, manipulate, and visualize data.



### About Me:

My name is JoÃ£o VÃ­tor Oliveira Alexandre, joe is actually a nickame. I'm a ex-biotech student that switched career paths. I'm a regular Brazilian. I Love to go to the beach, drink some caipirinhas, working out and watching documentaries about nature.
Like any data nerd, a deep impulse fuels my soul into investigate and uncover insights. Delivering meaningful data and helping others make informed decisions always boosts my dopamine levels.
My dedication and enthusiasm helped me so far to build a robust skill set in various data-related tools and techniques. My ultimate goal is to breathe life into unused data, delivering value through its transformation. And also being able to help my family. I'm a compulsive learner, "The moment you stop learning you start dying". Also, Kafka is my favorite writer. 



Future Goals:

As I pursue my path towards becoming a skilled data analyst, I'm committed to continuously expand my knowledge and capabilities. I actively engage in learning new tools and techniques to keep up with the ever-evolving landscape of data analytics. Collaboration and fresh opportunities are always welcome, as they enable me to further enhance my expertise and contribute to impactful data-driven projects. In the long run, I aspire to learn more about machine learning techniques and analytics to unlock even deeper insights. Feel free to explore and connect!
